Title: HCS12 Microcontroller: Memory Dump

Description:
For this memory dump program we were given a set of data in consecutive memory locations. The goal was to print this memory in hexadecimal. The program prints a value, wait for the user to press the space bar and then print the next value
and so on. The program ignores all the keystrokes except the space bar. The program also maintains a counter. The counter is initially zero, and incremented after each output. 
HCS12 Assembly language was used
