Title: HCS12 Microcontroller: Clock - Timer - External Interrupts

Description:
The program begins by using a timer interrupt to design a simple
digital clock.  This clock will count only minutes and seconds, and start at 00:00 every time your program starts. The
display on the screen should read according to the format mm:ssThe displays updates once every second. There is also a ticking sound on the speaker once every second.
The external interrupts on PORT H are used to control the
digital clock.  The clock program becomes a "stopwatch". One switch on PORT H is used
for starting the clock (start button) and one for stopping the clock (stop
button).  When the start button is
pressed, it will reset the clock (set the clock to 00:00) and enable the timer
to start counting. On the other hand, when the stop button is pressed, it will
disable the timer (stop the clock and stop display updates). A third button on
PORT H is used to toggle "silent mode". Pressing this button makes
the speaker go silent (no clicking sound) and pressing it again restores the
sound. All button presses are handled using external
interrupts. HCS12 Assembly language is used
