Title: HCS12 Microcontroller: Bit Manipulation – Pushbutton Switch Input – DIP switch input – LED output.

Description:
This program will receives inputs from pushbuttons. The board has four push buttons on PORTH that are used: PTH0, PTH1, PTH2 and PTH3. The program should
manipulate the value on the LED’s based on user input. The program does the
following depending on the user input:i. User presses PTH3: The program loads a
“random” value to the LED’s on PORTB.ii. User presses PTH2: The program logically
shifts left the bits on PORTB by one bit position.iii. User presses PTH1: The program arithmetic shifts right the bits by one position.iv. User presses PTH0: The program causes the four leftmost bits
on PTH as set by the DIP switches in the red
DIP switch bank to be written to the four rightmost bits of PORTB (LED's). (PH7-4 are written to PORTB3-0 resp.) The
upper 4-bits of PORTB will be cleared.Note that the program should pause for
approximately 200 milliseconds between checking user inputs. This is for
debounce delay.
